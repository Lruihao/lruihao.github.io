## Requirements

- FixIt v0.4.0 or later.

## Install Component

The installation method is the same as [installing a theme](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/documentation/installation/). There are several ways to install, choose one, for example, install through Hugo Modules:

```diff
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt"
+ [[module.imports]]
+   path = "github.com/hugo-fixit/shortcode-docs-bookmark"
```

## Configuration

In order to Inject the partial `fixit-docs-bookmark.html` into the `custom-head` through the [custom block](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/references/blocks/) opened by the FixIt theme in the `layouts/_partials/custom.html` file, you need to fill in the following necessary configurations:

```toml
[params]
  [params.customPartials]
    # ... other partials
    head = [ "inject/fixit-docs-bookmark.html" ]
    # ... other partials
```

## Use Shortcode

Here is an example of usage:

```markdown
{{?{}< fixit-docs-bookmark >}}
```
