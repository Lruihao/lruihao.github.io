虽然我英语四级没过，词汇量也不很多，甚至下降了很多，但是对于英语的语法我还是很喜欢的，马上快四级了又，复习整理一下以前的语法笔记。**以下内容纯手打！！**
先从倒装句开始吧！分为三大类，部分倒装，完全倒装和形式倒装。先复习第一种。

<!--more-->
> **部分倒装： 把谓语动词的一部分（`助动词，be动词，情态动词`）提到主语前面。**

### xx也如此，xx也一样
表示前面的内容也适用于后者，用`"so/nor/neither + 动词 + 主语"`句型。表`“xx也如此，xx也一样”`。可用`,`、`;`、`and`隔开（注意情形）。

**例句**
1. They love having lots of friends`,` `{% spoiler so do %}`the disabled.(这里`the + 形容词`表一类人)
2. I have had a new idea`;` `{% spoiler so has %}`my friends.
3. Lily <u>can't</u> ride bicycle`,` `{% spoiler nor/neither can %}`lucy.
4. The injured look <u>disappointed(沮丧的)</u>`,` `{% spoiler so did %}`senior citizens.(老人) {% spoiler (否定前缀词≠否定) %}
5. If you <u>aren't</u> for the plan`;` `{% spoiler nor/neither will %}`I.<br>
{% spoiler **,** 或 **;**前的句子若为从句，先将主句补充出，其后再根据主句改。<br>这里主句应为： I will not be for the plan.(be for 同意) %}
6. It is burning(燃烧) hot today`,`  so it is(那确实) `{% spoiler and/; so was (it) %}`yesterday.{% spoiler (这里只用用and或;) %}
7. Everyone is here and looks upset`,` `{% spoiler so it is with Mary = it is the same with %}`Mary.<br>
{% spoiler 这个句型同样适用于前面的六个例子，但是前面是并列句必须用这个句型。 %}
8. The truth is that no one is perfect.When all potential(潜在的) for ugliness in removed`,` {% spoiler so is %} all of the potential for beauty. 

### 否定副词或含有否定的介词短位于句首
**例句**
1. <u>Neither</u> `does Mr.Green` know the matter(事件) <u>nor</u> `does he` care about it.<br>
{% spoiler neither……nor…… 既不也不&emsp;either……or……要么要么，不是就是 %}
2. <u>Not only</u> `did we` lose our way <u>but also</u> (we) came close to losing our lives.{% spoiler (come close to 接近，差一点就) %}
3. <u>Not until</u> I began to work hard `did I` realize how much time I had wasted.<br>
{% spoiler 从句不倒装，原句为：<br>I didn't realize how much time I had wasted until I began to work hard. %}
4. <u>No sooner</u> `had they` arrived at the tomb <u>than</u> they fell ill.(一……就……)
5. <u>In no case</u> `will we` give up half-way.
6. <u>Hardly</u> `does Jim` think it possible to finish the task <u>before/when</u> dark.<br>
{% spoiler hardly...before/when 一……就…… &emsp;这里取"几乎不"释义应该更合适. %}
7. <u>Not a (single)</u> mistake `has Mary` made so far.(玛丽到目前为止一个错误也没犯。)<br>
{% spoiler not a (single) + 单数名词  表示“一个也没有”%}
8. <u>In no time(立刻马上)</u> Jone worked out the figure(体积). (无否定不倒装)

### only + 状语位于句首
**例句**
1. <u>Only in this way</u> `are you` able to do it well.<br>
{% spoiler 倒装前：<br>You are able to do it well only in this way. %}
2. <u>Only when they returned home</u> `did they` understand what had happened.
3. <u>Only on such a trip</u> `will you` gain a better appreciation(理解) of Eurepean literature.
4. <u>Only the teacher</u> got the news that our school could have <u>a 4-day holiday.</u>{% spoiler (同位语从句，only+主语所以不倒装) %}

### So/Such...that...句型位于句首
> So + adj + a/an + 单数名词 = Such + a/an + adj + 单数名词   `如此...以至于...`
so侧重于adj/adv&emsp;such侧重于n.
比如，so many/much/few/little

**例句**
1. <u>So crowded</u> `was the art gallery(展览会)` <u>that</u> I couldn't  move about (it).
2. <u>Such good weather</u> `was it` <u>that</u> we all went out last week.
3. Such a lovely girl `is kate` that everyone likes her.
4. So loudly `did he` speak that even people next room could hear him.

### as引导让步狀语从句

> as引导让步状语从句(虽然，即使，尽管，无论)，把`从句`中的`表语，动词，副词`提至句首(as 后不用再倒装了)，当表语是名词时，提至句首时一律用零冠词(其中as可用though替代,倒装后省略but,though,however,even,though,although等)

**例句**
1. Child <u>as</u> he is,he knows a lot.
2. Poor as King was,he tried his best to help others.
3. Try as he may,he has never made his boss satisfied.
4. Search as you would,you could find no body in the room.
5. Much as I want to buy the car,I can't afford(支付) it.

### 把虚拟语气从句中的were,had,should提至句首，并省略if
**例句**
1. <u>Had</u> you followwed my advice,you couldn't have made such a silly mistake.
2. <u>Were</u> you not a boy,you could wear a dress.
3. <u>Should</u> he invite me,I might take part in this party.

### 表肯定含义的时间频率词位于句首
> always,often,many a time(many times多次),every + 时间,now and then(时不时的)

**例句**
1. <u>Many a time</u> `has he` offered me some good suggestions.
2. <u>Now and then</u> `does my class teacher` warn us not yo use cellphones in the classroom.

### 疑问句用部分倒装
普通的疑问句：
How do you do that?
除了：
What is wrong? = What is the matter?
...
